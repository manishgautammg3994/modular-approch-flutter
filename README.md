```bash

Newer than known valid Java version (20.0.1), gradle (7.6.3).
 Treating as valid configuration.
The configured version of Java detected may conflict with the Gradle version in your new Flutter app.

[RECOMMENDED] If so, to keep the default Gradle version 7.6.3, make
sure to download a compatible Java version
(Java 11 <= compatible Java version < Java 20).
You may configure this compatible Java version by running:
`flutter config --jdk-dir=<JDK_DIRECTORY>`
Note that this is a global configuration for Flutter.


Alternatively, to continue using your configured Java version, update the Gradle
version specified in the following file to a compatible Gradle version:
C:\Users\DEEPAK SHARMA\AndroidStudioProjects\Antinna\antinna\android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

You may also update the Gradle version used by running
`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=<COMPATIBLE_GRADLE_VERSION>`.

See
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#java for details
on compatible Java/Gradle versions, and see
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:upgrading_wrapper
for more details on using the Gradle Wrapper command to update the Gradle version
used.
